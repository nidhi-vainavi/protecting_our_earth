    <h1>OZONE Layer</h1>
    <h2>Get in the ZONE to save OZONE!</h2>
    <p>The ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs almost all of the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. <br> Emissions were increasing rapidly until the 1980s. <br> Ozone layer, also called ozonosphere, region of the upper atmosphere, between roughly 15 and 35 km (9 and 22 miles) above Earth’s surface, containing relatively high concentrations of ozone molecules .

   <h3>
       1.Avoid the consumption of gases that are dangerous to the ozone layer. <br> <br>
       2.Minimize the use of cars <br> <br>
       3.Do not use cleaning products that are harmful to the environment and to us. <br> <br>
       4.Maintain air conditioners, as their malfunctions cause CFC to escape into the atmosphere. <br> <br>
       5.Don’t buy aerosol products with chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). <br> <br>
       6.Dispose of pre-1995 refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioning units properly. <br> <br>
       7.Talk to your friends about how they can protect the ozone layer. <br> <br>
       8.Drive less. Nitrous oxide is now the largest ozone-depleting substance released by human activities. <br> <br>
       9.
       Eat less meat. Nitrous oxide is also produced when manure decomposes, making poultry, beef, and dairy farms large producers of the gas.

      <h1>How to save our Earth</h1>
      <h3>
          1.Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural resources and landfill space. <br><br>
          2.Shop wisely. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag. <br><br>
          3.Plant a tree. Trees provide food and oxygen. They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate change. <br><br>
          4.Don't send chemicals into our waterways. Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office. <br><br>
          5.Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in the ocean. <br> <br>
          6.Volunteer. Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too. <br> <br>
          7.Unplug appliances when they are not in use. <br> <br>
          8.Use both sides of the paper. <br> <br>
          9.Walk to work. <br> <br>
          10.Use cloth bags instead of plastics. <br> <br>
          11.We can use natural or organic dyes instead of synthetic dyes. <br> <br>
